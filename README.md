## :heart: Introduction 
Welcome to Find-a-Wish, where organizations and good Samaritans can communicate with each other to do social good!

Organizations can use our web app to publish their profile, which includes which organization they are, their contact information, and the stuff they need to continue their mission. Users can access those profiles, see which items are needed where, and decide which organizations they want to donate to, either by donating their own things or shopping online. The users can get in touch with the organization in order to coordinate shipping and let the organization know what items they would like to donate. This way, everyone can contribute to the betterment of any community!


## :whale: Deployment: Sprint 5 Engineering Focus

You can find this web app deployed at [find-a-wish.onrender.com](https://find-a-wish.onrender.com/).

   

## :earth_americas: How it Works!

Home Page: Where the user will be able to see the details about Find-a-Wish and what they could do to give back to these organizations:

Wishlist: Where Organizations will be able to put in their information and wishlists for other good Samaritans to help out with:

Organizations: Here, the user and the wishlist poster will be able to see all of the organization profiles with their wishlists. You can find a wish to grant here!

## :sparkles: Intended Functionality
 - Once an organization inputs their information and wishlist into the form, then they'll get their own profile on the organizations page, but the information outputs on the console for now.
 - Organization and user authentication
 - Organization deletion by original poster
 - Links for the items to buy online or checkboxes to donate
